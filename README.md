# prework-study-guide

## Description

I have created a webpage to help me categorise my notes from the University of Sydney's Coding Bootcamp. The library consists of notes from four main topics:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Git & Github
4. Javascript

The library helps me familiarise myself with basic coding concepts. 

## Installation

No installation necessary.

## Usage

Feel free to use and explore my notes, but please reference my work should you refer or use it in your own work. If you open the Chrome Developer tools, you will see a function and 'for' loops at work.

## Credits

This guide was made in conjunction with several tutors and online resources from the University of Sydney.
